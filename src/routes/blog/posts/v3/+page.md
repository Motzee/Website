It's hard to believe that it's two years since the launch of v2. Our mission with Files is to build the best file manager for Windows, and we're proud to be building it out in the open so everyone can participate. User feedback helps shape the features we work on, & the bug reports on GitHub help to make Files more reliable. We're keenly aware that we wouldn't have gotten to this point without the support of our dedicated users and the open source community, and we want to extend a thank you to everyone who's been involved with the project until this point.

Starting today, v3 is now available to download. If you already have Files, there will be a notification on the toolbar to install the update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our [download page](/download/). You can also purchase Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) to help support the project.

**TL;DR:** Files v3 includes a refreshed design, faster startup performance, a command palette, support for previewing Offices documents, a speed graph for file operations, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v3

### Design updates

When we set out to update the design, we wanted to ensure users would feel at home with the app they love. We were careful not to move the options and commands users are familiar with, whilst modernizing and refreshing core parts of the UI.

- With v3 being one of the larger releases to date, we decided it was a good time to refresh the logo. After exploring a number of ideas and color combinations, we asked the community to help choose a color. It's probably no surprise, but the community overwhelmingly opted in favor of the familiar yellow color. We also updated the icons for the developer and preview versions of Files (purple & blue) to make it easier to identify the different variants of the app.

- We redesigned the sidebar from the ground up, removing the icons from headers and the indentations from child items. We also added icons to highlight pinned folders.
- We rounded the corners on the file area and adjusted the background opacity to provide more distinction between the sidebar.

### Keep Files in the background

Improving startup performance is one of our top priorities we'll continue to work on this in future updates. There are a number of reasons why progress has been slow, but in order to provide a quicker solution, we added an option to keep Files in the background when closing the last window. This option is enabled by default, but can be turned on/off from the advanced settings page.

### Added a Command Palette

With hundreds of available features, it can be hard for to keep track of all the features and keyboard shortcuts. To help with this, we're excited to introduce a Command Palette where you search for and trigger commands. To access the command palette, you can use the `ctrl` + `shift` + `p` keyboard shortcut, or alternatively you can enter `>` into the address bar and start searching for a command. 

### Rich previews for your Office documents

In addition to support for previewing Office documents, we added support for previewing file formats with a registered shell preview handler.

### Improved experience for file operations

You can now track the progress and speed of file operations in the Status Center with the new graph feature.
